# Obsidian Workspace Folder Hider

Workspace Folder Hider is a plugin that allows you to hide folders and/or files for different workspaces.

Some may find it useful to hide utility-type folders such as templates, attachments, scripts, etc. during normal usage and switch to a "Maintenance" workspace to work with them. You may find other uses as well.

> Individual files may be hidden as well. The file extension must be included which may not be readily apparent in the tree.

## Documentation & download link
